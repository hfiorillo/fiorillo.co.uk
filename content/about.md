A passionate DevOps engineer currently living in Manchester (UK) and working at Naimuri. My experiences lie in Cloud Engineering (Azure + AWS), Systems Administration & Engineering, Support and Automation. I thoroughly enjoy designing, building, managing, maintaing and monitoring cloud _(and my own bare metal, raspberry pis!)_ infrastructure. I am a constant learner, problem solver and hard worker who loves contributing a cause far greater than my own.

Off my computer you'll tend to find me out with friends, enjoying music events and hiking/cycling.
