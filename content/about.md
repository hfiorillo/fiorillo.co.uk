#Â About me

A reletively new and passionate DevOps professional. My back is in Cloud Engineering and Administration (Mainly in Azure but AWS too). I thoroughly enjoy building, managing, maintaing and monitoring cloud _(and my own bare metal)_ infrastructure.

Off my computer you'll tend to find me at a pub with mates, enjoying music events or out hiking/cycling.
